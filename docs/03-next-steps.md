# Next steps

- Try out [local mode](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/develop/local-mode),
  which allows you to build and sync code to your device locally for rapid
  development.
- Develop an application with [multiple containers](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/develop/multicontainer)
  to provide a more modular approach to application management.
- Manage your device fleet with the use of [configuration](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/manage/configuration/)
  and [environment](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/manage/serv-vars/) variables.
